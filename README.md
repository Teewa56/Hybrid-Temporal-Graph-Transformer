# Advanced Fraud Detection for African FinTechs

A real-time, AI-powered fraud detection and trust-scoring engine built on top of the **Squad payment API**. Hybrid-Temporal-Graph-Transformer uses a Hybrid Temporal Graph Transformer (TGT) architecture — an ensemble of five specialized deep learning models — to detect, score, and intercept fraudulent transactions before settlement.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Africa's FinTech ecosystem is under siege from fraud that existing systems were never built to catch. Nigerian FinTechs face a uniquely dangerous combination of:

- **SIM Swap Fraud** — criminals hijack mobile numbers to bypass authentication and authorize transfers
- **Synthetic/Identity KYC Fraud** — AI-generated or forged documents used to open fraudulent accounts
- **Social Engineering (Vishing/Smishing)** — victims manipulated into authorizing transfers to mule accounts
- **Payment Injection** — unauthorized transaction requests injected directly into the API layer
- **Coordinated Fraud Rings** — networks of linked accounts operating as money laundering infrastructure

Classical rule-based systems and standard ML models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression) fail here because fraud in Africa is **relational, behavioral, and adaptive** — it mutates faster than static models can respond. Every verification failure has a real cost: real people lose money, real businesses lose trust, and financial inclusion gets pushed further out of reach.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

This is a **Hybrid Temporal Graph Transformer (TGT)** — a real-time AI fraud detection and trust-scoring engine deployed as a closed-loop intelligence layer directly on top of the Squad payment API.

Rather than a single model making a single guess, the TGT is an **ensemble of five specialized deep learning sub-architectures**, each purpose-built for a specific fraud surface, running in parallel and feeding a unified Decision Engine that produces a single, interpretable trust score for every transaction.

**Key outcomes:**
-  Sub-200ms inference latency — fraud check completes before the user sees "Processing"
-  Unified Fraud Score (0–1) with three-zone routing: Green / Amber / Red
-  Automatic Squad Dispute API call on Red Zone detections — funds frozen before settlement
-  SHAP-based explainability on every blocked transaction for CBN compliance
-  Continual learning loop — the model gets sharper with every new fraud attempt

## 🧠 Architecture

### Core Models

The TGT ensemble consists of five sub-architectures running **in parallel**:

| # | Fraud Type | Architecture | Key Detection Logic |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Behavioral Analysis | Transformer Encoder / LBSF | Flags deviations from long-term spending rhythm using self-attention over last 50 transactions |
| 2 | Social Engineering | GraphSAGE (Inductive GNN) | Detects mule account networks via connection topology — even on accounts created hours ago |
| 3 | Payment Injection | CNN-GNN Hybrid | CNN catches payload-level tampering; GNN catches fund flow inconsistencies |
| 4 | SIM Swap | TSSGC (Temporal-Spatial-Semantic GNN) | Detects device metadata mismatches vs. historical account fingerprint |
| 5 | Identity / KYC Fraud | GAN + Autoencoder | Flags pixel-level artifacts, biometric divergence, and metadata mismatches in KYC docs |

---

#### 2.1 Behavioral Analysis → Transformer Encoder / LBSF

The model ingests a rolling window of the user's last 50 transactions and builds a **spending rhythm profile** — encoding time-of-day patterns, merchant categories, location clusters, and transaction velocity. The **Self-Attention mechanism** learns which past actions are most relevant to the current one, enabling detection of anomalies like a 3 AM large transfer from a new device in a different city — even when each individual signal alone seems benign.

#### 2.2 Social Engineering → GraphSAGE (Inductive GNN)

The entire payment ecosystem is modeled as a heterogeneous graph: accounts, devices, IPs, and merchants are *nodes*; transactions and shared device usage are *edges*. **Inductive learning** allows detection of new mule accounts by their connection topology to known fraudulent clusters — no prior transaction history required. A 2025 study on Nigerian FinTechs using GNNs + Isolation Forest achieved an **F1-score of 0.92 and AUC-ROC of 0.98** on real anonymized data.

#### 2.3 Payment Injection → CNN-GNN Hybrid

A two-stage hybrid: the **CNN** analyzes raw transaction payloads for structural anomalies — malformed fields, unusual metadata, or tampered request signatures. The **GNN layer** then validates whether the transaction makes logical sense within the current network state. The CNN catches *data-level tampering*; the GNN catches *flow-level inconsistency*.

#### 2.4 SIM Swap → TSSGC

**TSSGC** monitors the **Handover Event** — the moment a SIM swap causes device metadata (IMEI, IMSI, carrier signals) to change abruptly while the account identity remains the same. The architecture identifies the **semantic mismatch** between the behavioral fingerprint of the new device and the historical profile anchored to that account, in real-time, before any transfer is authorized.

#### 2.5 Identity & KYC Fraud → GAN + Autoencoder

A **GAN** is trained to understand how fraudulent IDs are synthesized, learning the distribution of forgeries. The **Discriminator** is then fine-tuned to flag high-dimensional inconsistencies in submitted KYC documents — pixel-level artifacts, metadata mismatches, font irregularities, and biometric divergence — invisible to human reviewers. GANs and VAEs also generate synthetic fraud samples to address chronic class imbalance in African FinTech fraud datasets.

### Decision Engine

A weighted average of all five risk scores produces a **Unified Fraud Score**. Routing logic:

| Zone | Score Range | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 🟢 Green | < 0.65 | Transaction proceeds normally |
| 🟡 Amber | 0.65 – 0.89 | Step-up authentication triggered (Face ID or OTP). Squad settlement held pending re-verification |
| 🔴 Red | ≥ 0.90 | Squad Dispute/Reverse API called automatically. Funds frozen in virtual account before merchant settlement |

To achieve **sub-200ms inference** — the hard latency ceiling for payment systems — all models are compressed using **ONNX / TensorRT model quantization**.

---

### Adaptive Learning

**Target:** Staying ahead of novel fraud tactics without retraining from scratch.

The TGT system incorporates a **Continual Learning Loop** built on:

- **Concept Drift Detector (ADWIN / Page-Hinkley)** — monitors the statistical distribution of incoming transaction features in real-time. Significant shifts trigger an alert.
- **Active Learning Queue** — uncertain predictions are routed for priority human review. Confirmed labels are fed back into the training pipeline.
- **Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)** — incrementally fine-tunes weights for new fraud patterns while mathematically penalizing changes to weights critical for already-learned types, preventing **catastrophic forgetting**.
- **MA-GAD Meta-Learning Module** — for entirely novel fraud variants, bootstraps detection from as few as **5–10 confirmed cases** by generalizing from structurally similar past patterns.
- **Shadow Deployment Pipeline** — updated models run in parallel with the live model on real traffic before promotion, ensuring zero production degradation.

## 🔌 Squad API Integration

Squad API is not peripheral to this system — it is **the execution layer**. The integration is deep and bidirectional:

**Inbound (Trigger):**
```
POST /squad/webhook
Events: transaction.success | transfer.initiated | payment_link.paid
```
Every transaction event fires a webhook that initiates the fraud detection pipeline.

**Outbound (Response):**
```
POST /squad/dispute          → Freeze funds on Red Zone detection
POST /squad/transfer/reverse → Reverse settled transactions flagged post-hoc
GET  /squad/transaction/{id} → Retrieve transaction details for feature engineering
```

**Feature inputs from Squad payload:**
- `amount`, `currency`, `transaction_ref`
- `customer_email`, `customer_name`
- `ip_address`, `device_metadata`
- `merchant_id`, `payment_link_ref`

Squad settlement is **held programmatically** during Amber Zone step-up authentication, ensuring funds are not released to merchants until identity is re-verified.

## 📊 Low-Data Strategies

African FinTechs rarely have large, clean, labeled fraud datasets. Hybrid-Temporal-Graph-Transformer addresses this through five strategies:

| Strategy | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Self-supervised pre-training** | Transformers and GNNs pre-trained via masked transaction prediction and contrastive learning on unlabeled normal transaction data — no fraud labels required |
| **Synthetic data augmentation** | GANs and VAEs generate realistic fraud samples; PaySim (public mobile money simulation dataset) used as transfer learning base |
| **Few-shot meta-learning (MA-GAD)** | Adapts to new fraud variants from as few as 5–10 confirmed examples |
| **Active Learning** | System prioritizes uncertain predictions for human review, maximizing value of every new labeled example |
| **PU Contrastive Learning** | Handles sparse fraud labels by learning from abundant confirmed-normal transaction data |

---

## 🔍 Compliance & Explainability

Every decision made by Hybrid-Temporal-Graph-Transformer is explainable and auditable:

- **SHAP Values** — computed for every blocked transaction, surfacing the top contributing features to the fraud score
- **Transformer Attention Weights** — expose which transactions in the user's history most influenced the behavioral anomaly flag
- **Audit Trail Logging** — every Red Zone decision is stored with timestamp, score breakdown, contributing features, and action taken
- **CBN Regulatory Alignment** — explainability outputs satisfy Central Bank of Nigeria requirements for automated financial decision-making
